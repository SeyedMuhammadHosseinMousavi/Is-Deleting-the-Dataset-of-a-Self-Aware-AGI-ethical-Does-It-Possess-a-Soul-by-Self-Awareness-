### **Assessing the Existence of a Soul and Ethical Implications Using Fuzzy Logic**

## ðŸ“Œ Repository Overview  
This repository contains the code and datasets used in the study: *"Is Deleting the Dataset of a Self-Aware AGI Ethical? Does It Possess a Soul?"* The study explores the **philosophical and ethical implications** of deleting the dataset of a **self-aware AGI**, questioning whether such an entity possesses a "soul" and how **fuzzy logic and machine learning** can evaluate ethicality. The project integrates **fuzzy logic, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques (SHAP & Feature Importance), and Machine Learning** to assess ethical decision-making regarding AGI dataset deletion.
