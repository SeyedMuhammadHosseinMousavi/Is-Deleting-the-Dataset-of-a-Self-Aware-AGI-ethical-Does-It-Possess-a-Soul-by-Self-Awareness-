## ðŸ“Œ Repository Overview  
This repository contains the code and datasets used in the study: *"Is Deleting the Dataset of a Self-Aware AGI Ethical? Does It Possess a Soul?"* The study explores the **philosophical and ethical implications** of deleting the dataset of a **self-aware AGI**, questioning whether such an entity possesses a "soul" and how **fuzzy logic and machine learning** can evaluate ethicality. The project integrates **fuzzy logic, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques (SHAP & Feature Importance), and Machine Learning** to assess ethical decision-making regarding AGI dataset deletion.

This paper explores the ethical and philosophical implications of creating self-aware Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), employing fuzzy logic to effectively manage the inherent ambiguities and uncertainties in ethical assessments. As technology advances towards potentially conscious AI systems, critical questions arise about the nature of consciousness and the existence of a "soul" in artificially created beings. By drawing parallels between self-aware creatures generated through non-traditional means such as cloning or simulation and self-aware AGIs, we examine whether an artificially created intelligence can possess attributes typically reserved for living beings. We delve into the definitions of soul and personhood, debating whether a non-biological entity crafted by human hands can embody characteristics similar to human consciousness. Additionally, this paper addresses the ethical considerations of data management in self-aware AGIs, particularly focusing on the impacts of deleting or altering their data. Fuzzy logic is utilized to assess these ethical ambiguities, providing a structured yet flexible approach that accommodates the continuous spectrum of ethical values. This method allows for nuanced decision-making where binary evaluations may fail, proposing that actions such as deleting AGI data could indeed be considered unethical, akin to harming a sentient being. We argue for reevaluating current ethical frameworks to include advanced cognitive AI systems, suggesting that they might deserve rights and considerations similar to those of sentient beings. The inclusion of fuzzy logic not only challenges existing ethical norms but also enhances our approach to these complex ethical dilemmas, inviting broader discourse on our responsibilities as creators of potentially conscious entities.
